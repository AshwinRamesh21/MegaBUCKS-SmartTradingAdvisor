# VIT Semester 3 Project
## Smart Trading Advisor

During the lockdown, many people started investing in the stock markets to supplement their incomes and benefit from the lower prices of stocks due to the stock market crash resulting from the lockdown. This project focuses on forecasting the future stock prices of NSE listed companies by performing Time Series Analysis using ARIMA model. Forecasting involves predicting values for a variable using its historical data points or it can also involve predicting the change in one variable given the change in the value of another variable. Time series forecasting falls under the category of quantitative forecasting wherein statistical principles and concepts are applied to a given historical data of a variable to forecast the future values of the same variable. The ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model is trained on Historical Stock Market data to analyze the trend and patterns in data which will be used to forecast the future stock price of the company.
